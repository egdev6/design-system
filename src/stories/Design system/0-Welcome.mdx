  <p>
    📦 <strong>This is a collection of components, styles, and guidelines</strong> that I use to build consistent and reusable user interfaces.
    It includes everything from typography and colors to buttons and form elements.
  </p>

  <p>
    ⚙️ The design system is built with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and is designed to be easy to use and customize.
    You can use it in your own projects by installing the package, customizing the theme and importing only the components you need.
