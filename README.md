## ‚öõÔ∏è Component Workflow

This project follows a structured workflow to ensure that each component is properly researched, developed, documented, and reviewed before being merged into `main`.

### üîÑ Development Phases

1. **Functionality Research**  
   Explore similar solutions, design patterns, and real user needs. This phase helps define a component that is useful and aligned with the system.

2. **Define Component Functionality**  
   Specify props, variants, states, expected behavior, and accessibility requirements.

3. **Component Implementation**  
   Build the component based on the previous definitions. This includes variants, styles, and required logic.

4. **Component Documentation**  
   Each component must include proper documentation in Storybook (controls, usage examples, and use cases). Optionally, include JSDoc comments or `.mdx` files.

5. **Code Review and Adjustments**  
   Functional and visual review of the component. This step may include bug fixes and suggested improvements.

6. **Merge into `main`**  
   Once approved, the component is merged into the main branch with complete functionality and documentation.

## ‚úÖ Project Requirements

To keep the project clean, consistent, and easy to maintain, we follow these guidelines:

### üß± UI Libraries
- Use the Guidelines stablished in Storybook's documentation (colors, fonts, spaces, etc)
- The only allowed UI library is **Radix UI**, using its **unstyled primitives**.
- You may also use **any existing dependencies already present** in the project.
- If there is an urgent need to add a new dependency, please **discuss it first with the Project Lead**.

### ü§ñ Use of AI
- The use of **AI tools is allowed** for both component implementation and documentation.
- However, the **final result must meet the quality and standards of the project**.  
  (You can refer to already published components as examples.)

### üí° Suggesting Components or Features
- If you come up with ideas for **new components** or **feature needs**, feel free to **reach out to the Project Lead** to discuss it.
- You can use In Review tab in the kanban project to propose new components too.

We aim for clean, maintainable and scalable code. These requirements help ensure that everyone is aligned and contributions remain consistent.
